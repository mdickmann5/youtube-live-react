# Youtube Live React

A simple, self-contained, React component that looks for live Youtube videos of a specific channel, and renders the corresponding iframe objects if there are any available.


## Demo & Examples

Live demo: [agustinaliagac.github.io/youtube-live-react](http://agustinaliagac.github.io/youtube-live-react/)

To build the examples locally, run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in a browser.


## Installation

The easiest way to use youtube-live-react is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), etc).

You can also use the standalone build by including `dist/youtube-live-react.js` in your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included React, and it is available as a global variable.

```
npm install youtube-live-react --save
```


## Usage

Simply create the component, specifying your Google API Key, and the Youtube channel Id from where you want to look up live stream videos. The component will load the google client JS script, inject it into the DOM, specifically inside the body tag, and then perform the API query and render process. If you don't know the channel's id check [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16326307/3148273). Check the available properties you can override in the following section.

```
var React = require('react');
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');
var YoutubeLive = require('youtube-live-react');

var App = React.createClass({
	render () {
		return (
			<div>
				<YoutubeLive
					iframeWidth={400}
					iframeHeight={300}
					maxResults={50}
          youtubeChannelId='{YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID}'
          googleApiKey='{YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY}'/>
			</div>
		);
	}
});

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));

```

### Properties

| Property | Description | Required | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| iframeWidth | The iframe's object width | No | '560'
| iframeHeight | The iframe's object height | No | '315'
| maxResults | Max results from API (max. is 50) | No | 10
| youtubeChannelId | Your channel's ID | Yes |
| googleApiKey | Your Google API Key | Yes |
| containerStyle | The main div style | No |
| itemContainerStyle | The style for each div containing an iframe | No |


## Development (`src`, `lib` and the build process)

**NOTE:** The source code for the component is in `src`. A transpiled CommonJS version (generated with Babel) is available in `lib` for use with node.js, browserify and webpack. A UMD bundle is also built to `dist`, which can be included without the need for any build system.

To build, watch and serve the examples (which will also watch the component source), run `npm start`. If you just want to watch changes to `src` and rebuild `lib`, run `npm run watch` (this is useful if you are working with `npm link`).
